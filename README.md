### üîç Key SQL Queries
```sql
-- Total Revenue
SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales;

-- Average Order Value
SELECT (SUM(total_price)/COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)) AS Avg_order_Value FROM pizza_sales;

-- Daily Order Trend
SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_date) AS order_day, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(DW, order_date);

-- Sales by Category
SELECT pizza_category, SUM(total_price) AS total_revenue
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_category;

-- Average Pizzas Per Order
SELECT CAST(CAST(SUM(quantity) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / 
CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS DECIMAL(10,2))
AS Avg_Pizzas_per_order
FROM pizza_sales

-- Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category :
SELECT pizza_category, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as total_revenue,
CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) from pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_category

-- Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold :
SELECT Top 5 pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS Total_Pizza_Sold
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Pizza_Sold DESC

-- Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold :
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS Total_Pizza_Sold
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Pizza_Sold ASC
